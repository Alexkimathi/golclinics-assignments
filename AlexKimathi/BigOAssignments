    # time complexity 0(n) 

    #space complexity 0(1) its a constant and no auxilliary memory is required

    #count down recuersive
    #time complexity O(n) the countdown will be called as many times as thes ize of n

    #palindrome
    #the output is True
    #time complexity O(n) countdown will be called n times
    # space complexity o(n)

    #reversed palindrome
    #time complexity o(s) reversal is dependent on size of s
     # space complexity o(s)
